It was first held in 2022 and has since become an annual event. The name GEFE represents the core aspects of the event: a forum and an exhibition, both dedicated to the green economy.. The venue for this significant trade fair, the Thiskyhall Sala Convention Center, is located in Ho Chi Minh City. This choice of venue highlights Vietnam's increasing importance in the global green economy. The fair is held annually in autumn and regularly attracts a variety of participants. The organizer of GEFE is the European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam (EuroCham), which plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable business practices and significantly contributes to strengthening trade relations between Europe and Vietnam. The main themes of the fair cover a wide range: renewable energy, sustainable finance, decarbonization, green building, circular economy, solutions to the water crisis, sustainable food and agriculture, digitalization, new technologies, sustainable tourism, and transportation. A special highlight of GEFE is the conferences and seminars, where leading experts lecture on current topics such as renewable energy, green buildings, digitalization, the future of fuels, and green tourism. These events serve as platforms for exchanging ideas and promoting innovative approaches. The fair attracts exhibitors from various industries, including energy, finance, construction, technology, and tourism. The main visitors include professionals from these fields as well as representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations advocating for sustainable practices and policies. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the Thiskyhall Sala Convention Center in Ho Chi Minh City not only stands out for its accessibility but also symbolizes the dynamic development of the city and its commitment to sustainability and innovation. The third edition of the Green Economy Forum & Exhibition (GEFE) takes place on 3 days from Mon., 21.10.2024 to Wed., 23.10.2024 in Ho Chi Minh City.",NaN,#ERROR!,NaN,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,https://events-watch.com/dl/home/s/2a2f75/r/0vWAbpVUS3i0U3JgLyOAIA,https://airtable.com/appvgAvzkPhBQ2NDa/tblonOGpdjgZtizWi/viw5WU2qMcUwQmaex/recQQTTccAiLhU7DZ,NaN,NaN,NaN,2024-07-05 5:08pm,NaN

This major event is organized by Solar Energy Trade Shows, LLC in close collaboration with industry leaders SEIA (Solar Energy Industries Association) and SEPA (Smart Electric Power Alliance). The event takes place annually, rotating between various US cities. The ‚ÄúRE+‚Äù primarily focuses on topics such as solar energy, energy storage, microgrids, hydrogen, wind energy, and electric vehicles. Visitors can expect a thorough presentation of products and services from areas like manufacturing, construction/EPC, project development, and many others. The expo attracts exhibitors from a myriad of sectors, from technology and software to financing and system integration. As the primary attendees hail from the same sectors, the expo becomes a central hub for experts. Special highlights of ‚ÄúRE+‚Äù include live microgrid demonstrations, discussions about the evolving Grid-of-Grids infrastructure, and emphasis on trends in electric vehicle charging and hydrogen solutions. Moreover, strategies for carbon reduction and green hydrogen are focal points. Additionally, valuable strategies and advice for PV installations and energy storage systems are provided. A specific seminar group, RE+ Tech, delves deeply into scientifically innovative research in the solar, storage, and smart energy sector. Although the ‚ÄúRE+‚Äù expo is unique in its format, it is part of a series of expos dedicated to renewable energy topics. In conclusion, each expo location is meticulously chosen to ensure both optimal accessibility and top-tier facilities for visitors. The RE+ will take place on 4 days from Monday, 09.

Especially in China, the second largest electricity market in the world, the issue of energy is becoming increasingly important. Due to the increasing economic capacity, there is a steadily rising energy consumption. Accordingly, it is important to meet with the latest technologies and developments. In China, the subject of ""green power"" becomes more and more important,too, because China daily faces high environmental and particulate matter emissions that reduce the quality of urban life enormously. To all these questions and challenges the ES Energy Show provides solutions. International exhibitors show innovative technologies and products relating to the production and use of renewable energy, and provide information on the latest trends and developments in the market. In that case smart grids play an important role, which allow optimization and monitoring of the interconnected components such as power generators, storage, appliances and network resources. Furthermore decentralized power generation and its transmission and distribution are priority themes of the fair,too. The Energy Show will be held in conjunction with the IAS Industrial Automation Show and MWCS Metalworking and CNC Machine Tool Show. Together, the fairs generate a professional audience of more than 120,000 visitors and establish them as an important event in the exhibition landscape of China.

It takes place annually in the autumn as part of the China International Industry Fair (CIIF), a major event encompassing nine different expos. China holds the world's largest automobile market, and the Chinese government views electromobility as a means to promote the domestic auto industry and position China as a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs) and related technologies. Promoting electromobility not only helps to reduce urban air pollution but also contributes to lowering the country's overall CO2 emissions. The development of electric vehicles and related technologies fosters innovation in other domains such as battery technology, artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving, thereby aiding China in taking a leading role in these crucial future technologies. The NEAS was established to advance and support the growth of electromobility in China and globally. The event is organized by Donghao Lansheng (Group) Co., Ltd., in collaboration with the China Machinery Industry Federation. The themes of NEAS encompass a wide array of products and services in the realm of electromobility, including electric cars, hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, electric buses, charging infrastructure, and numerous other related technologies and solutions. The focus lies on innovative and environmentally friendly technologies that contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and promoting sustainable mobility. Some highlights of the exhibition include the unveiling of new electric vehicle models, demonstrations of advanced technologies, expert industry presentations, and networking events that enable participants to establish connections and conduct business. As part of the CIIF, NEAS benefits from the substantial synergies of other prominent industry expos taking place simultaneously and at the same venue. These include the Industry Automation Show (IAS), Energy-Saving & Industrial Accessory Show (EIAS), Information & Communication Technology Show (ICTS), Metalworking and CNC Machine Tool Show (MWCS), Energy Show (ES), Robotics Show (RS), Scientific & Technological Innovation Show (STIS), and New Material Industry Show (NMIS).
